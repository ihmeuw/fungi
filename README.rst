Elasticsearch for storage of and queries on provenance data.
============================================================

This project provides storage and query of provenance
information for data and processes, using the format
underlying the `provda package for provenance management
<https://stash.ihme.washington.edu/users/adolgert/repos/provda/browse>`_.

This project's motivation is provision of command-line tools
for interacting with provenance information. It provides abstractions
and functionality for storing and querying provenance information for
data and processes, leveraging elasticsearch-py and elasticsearch-dsl-py.
